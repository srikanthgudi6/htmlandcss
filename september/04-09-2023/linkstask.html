    <p>The education system in AP has changed occasionally, yet the physical form of
        the school remains almost the same. More schools (primary and secondary) were built
        to fullfill the needs of the children education in Malaysia. A total of 10,117 number of
        school buildings; excluding the number of pre-schools, was recorded in AP. The same
        prototype school building design was repeated all over AP. The space planning of
        standard school building design is based on the syllabus of the latest curriculum for
        primary and secondary schools governed by the Ministry of Education. Two blocks that
        faced each other are connected with a bridge where shared staircases are designed in the
        middle or merely just a bridge for connectivity. Fire staircases are located either in the
        middle or at the end of the block, while toilets are always located at the end of the block.
        Gardens are used more like yards or working compound for specific subjects such as
        science or vocational landscape or co-curriculum activities. The existence of green
        surrounding is not emphasizing as maintenance to keep it clean, manageable and safe
        for the children can increase maintenance budget for the school. The environment and
        the physical surrounding of public schools do not really encourage the learning through
        nature or school as ‘third teacher’ or a laboratory for the green and sustainable living
        experience.The education system in AP has changed occasionally, yet the physical form of
