                <td bgcolor="#efffe">The lion (Panthera leo) is a large cat of the genus Panthera native to Africa and India. It has a
                    muscular, broad-chested body; short, rounded head; round ears; and a hairy tuft at the end of its
                    tail. It is sexually dimorphic; adult male lions are larger than females and have a prominent mane.
                    It is a social species, forming groups called prides. A lion's pride consists of a few adult males,
                    related females, and cubs. Groups of female lions usually hunt together, preying mostly on large
                    ungulates. The lion is an apex and keystone predator; although some lions scavenge when
                    opportunities occur and have been known to hunt humans, lions typically do not actively seek out and
                    prey on humans</td>

                <td bgcolor="#efffe">The lion inhabits grasslands, savannahs and shrublands. It is usually more diurnal than other wild
                    cats, but when persecuted, it adapts to being active at night and at twilight. During the Neolithic
                    period, the lion ranged throughout Africa and Eurasia from Southeast Europe to India, but it has
                    been reduced to fragmented populations in sub-Saharan Africa and one population in western India. It
                    has been listed as Vulnerable on the IUCN Red List since 1996 because populations in African
                    countries have declined by about 43% since the early 1990s. Lion populations are untenable outside
                    designated protected areas. Although the cause of the decline is not fully understood, habitat loss
                    and conflicts with humans are the greatest causes for concern.</td>
